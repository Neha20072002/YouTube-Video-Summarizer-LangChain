# Contributing to YouTube Video Summarizer

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We welcome issues, discussions, and pull requests.

## Getting Started
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run locally: `streamlit run app.py`.

## Development Guidelines
- Keep changes focused and small (one PR per logical change).
- Prefer clear, readable Python; add comments only for non-obvious logic.
- Update `README.md` when behavior or setup changes.
- Manually test the Streamlit UI for UX changes.

## Commit Messages
- Use imperative mood: "Add X", "Fix Y", "Update Z".
- Reference issues when applicable (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

## Pull Requests
- Base branch: `main`.
- Include a summary and screenshots/GIFs for UI changes.
- Ensure `streamlit run app.py` starts without errors.
